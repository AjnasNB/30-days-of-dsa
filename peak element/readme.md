# Question

Given an array arr of n elements that is first strictly increasing and then maybe strictly decreasing, find the maximum element in the array.
ie,
Find a peak element which is not smaller than its neighbours

## Example 1:

```
Input: array[]= {5, 10, 20, 15}
Output: 20
Explanation: The element 20 has neighbors 10 and 15, both of them are less t
```
## Example 2

```
Input: array[] = {10, 20, 15, 2, 23, 90, 67}
Output: 20 or 90
Explanation: The element 20 has neighbors 10 and 15, both of them are less than 20, similarly 90 has neighbors 23 and 67.
```
